#Health Care and Causes of Death by State

####Final Project for Dr. Cannata's Data Visualization Class

###Introduction

We have been working with these same two datasets (first is US healthcare expenditures over time, and second is US Causes of Death by State) for multiple R projects, so it was interesting to finally work with this data in Tableau. With the enhanced capability of Tableau, we wanted to drill down deeper into healthcare expenditures by item (hospital care, dental care, prescription drugs, etc.) and correlate these figures with deaths.

###Loading our data from the Oracle Database
```{r}
source("../01 Data/COD_ETL.R", echo = FALSE)
```

```{r}
source("../01 Data/NHCE_ETL.R", echo = FALSE)
```

```{r}
source("../01 Data/Graph1.R", echo = TRUE)
```
